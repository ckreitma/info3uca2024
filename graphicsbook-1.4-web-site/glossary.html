<hr class="break">
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">abstract class.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">In object-oriented programming, a class that is meant to be used
only as a basis for subclasses. Objects can be created from the subclasses, but not from
the abstract class itself.  The purpose of an abstract class is to define the properties
and behaviors that all of its subclasses have in common.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">address space (in WGSL).</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">WGSL memory is divided into address spaces.  
From the WGSL specification: "Each address space has unique properties 
determining mutability, visibility, the values it may contain, and 
how to use variables with it."</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">affine transform.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">A transform that preserves parallel lines.
That is, when the transform is applied to a pair of lines that are parallel, then the
resulting transformed lines are also parallel.  An affine transform, T, has the property
that the transform of the line segment between a point (x1,y1) and a point (x2,y2) is
the line between the points T(x1,y1) and T(x2,y2).  Effectively, the transform of a line
segment can be computed just by transforming its two endpoints.  This makes affine
transforms very efficient for computer graphics.  Any affine transform can be represented
as a composition of rotations, translations, and scalings.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">alignment (in WGSL).</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">Restrictions on the legal location of
a value in memory, depending on the data type.  For example, the address
of a vec3f variable in WGSL must be a multiple of 16.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">alpha blending.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">Using the alpha component of a color to blend the color with
a background color, when the color is drawn over the background color.  That is, the new color 
of a pixel is obtained by blending the drawing color with the current color, with the degree of 
blending depending on the alpha component of the drawing color.  Alpha blending is most
commonly used to simulate transparency.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">alpha color component.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">An extra component (that is, one of the numbers that are used
to specify a color) in a color model that is not part of the actual color specification.  The
alpha component is extra information.  It is most often used to specify the degree of
transparency of a color.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">ambient color.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">A material property that represents the proportion of
ambient light in the environment that is reflected by a surface.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">ambient light.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">Directionless light that exists in an environment but does not
seem to come from a particular source in the environment.  An approximation for light
that has been reflected so many times that its original source can't be identified.
Ambient light illuminates all objects in a scene equally.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">ambient occlusion.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">A rendering technique that takes into account the fact that ambient light
will illuminate different surfaces to varying extents, depending on the degree to which ambient light is blocked,
or "occluded," from reaching each surface by other geometry in the scene.  
Ambient occlusion is an improvement on basic ambient lighting, but, like ambient light itself,
it is not an actual physical phenomenon.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">anaglyph stereo.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">A technique for combining stereographic images of a scene, one for the
left eye and one for the right eye, into a single image.  Typically, the image for the left eye is
drawn using only shades of red, and the image for the right eye contains only blue and green
color components.  The 3D effect can be seen by viewing the combined image through
red/cyan glasses, which allow each eye to see only the image that is intended for that eye.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">animation.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">A sequence of images that, when displayed quickly one after the other,
will produce the impression of continuous motion or change.  The term animation also refers
to the process of creating such image sequences.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">anisotropic filtering.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">A technique for more accurate sampling of texture images, in the
case where a pixel on the surface that is being textured corresponds to a non-rectangular region in the
texture.  Anisotropic filtering is available as an optional extension in WebGL.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">antialiasing.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">A technique used to reduce the jagged or "staircase" appearance
of diagonal lines, text, and other shapes that are drawn using pixels.  When a pixel is only partly
covered by a geometric shape, then the color of the pixel is a blend of the color of the shape and
the color of the background, with the degree of blending depending on the fraction of the
pixel that is covered by the geometric shape.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">API.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">Application Programming Interface.  A collection of related classes, functions,
constants, etc., for performing some task.  An API is an "interface" in the sense that it
can be used without understanding how its functionality is actually implemented.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">aspect ratio.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">The ratio of the width, w, of a rectangle to the height, h, of the rectangle, 
expressed either as a ratio w:h or as a fraction w/h.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">async function.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">In JavaScript, an async function is one that can use
an "await" statement to wait for the result of a promise.  When an await statement is
executed, the execution of the async function is suspended until the promise has either
been fulfilled or rejected, giving other JavaScript code a chance to run in the
meantime.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">attenuation.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">Refers to the way that illumination from a point light or
spot light decreases with distance from the light.  Physically, illumination should
decrease with the square of the distance, but computer graphics often uses a linear
attenuation with distance, or no attenuation at at all.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">attribute.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">A property, such as color, of a graphical object.  An image can be specified
by the geometric shapes that it contains, together with their attributes.</span>

</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">axis of rotation.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">Rotation in 3D space is rotation about a line, which is called
the axis of rotation.  The axis of rotation remains fixed, while everything else moves
in circles around the axis.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">back face.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">One of the two sides of a polygon in 3D.
A polygon has two sides. One is taken to be the front face, and the other is the back face.  In OpenGL, the
difference is determined by the order in which the vertices of the polygon are
enumerated.  The default is that, seen from the back, the vertices are enumerated
in clockwise order around the polygon.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">

as a linear combination of the vertices of the triangle, that is, a*A+b*B+c*C, where A, B, and C
are the vertices and a, b, and c are numbers.  Any point in the triangle can be written in this form
where the coefficients a, b, and c have values in the range 0 to 1 and a+b+c is equal to 1.</span>

polynomial equations.  A cubic Bezier curve segment is defined by its two endpoints P1 and P2 and
by two control points C1 and C2.  The tangent to the curve (its direction and speed) at P1 is
given by the line from P1 to C1.  The tangent vector to the curve at P2 is given by 
the line from C2 to P2.  A quadratic Bezier curve is defined by its two endpoints and
a single control point C.  The tangent at each endpoint is the line between that endpoint
and&nbsp;C.</span>

<span class="glossary_term">BSDF.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function.  A generalization of the
idea of "material" in 3D graphics.  A BSDF gives the probability that a light ray that arrives
at point of space from one direction will leave that point heading in a another direction.
The probability is a function of the two directions, the point, and the wavelength of the light.
One kind of scattering is reflection of light from a surface.  For that case, the term
BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) is used.</span>
</p>

            <span class="glossary_definition">The default coordinate system in OpenGL.  The projection transform
maps the 3D scene to clip coordinates.  The rendered image will show the contents of the
cube in the clip coordinate system that contains x, y, and z values in the range from -1 to 1; anything
outside that range is "clipped" away.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">color buffer.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">In OpenGL, the region of memory that holds the color data for the

</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">color component.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">One of the numbers used in a color model to specify a color.
For example, in the RGB color model, a color is specified by three color components representing

<span class="glossary_term">color mask.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">In WebGL, a setting that determines which "channels" in the color
buffer are written during rendering.  The channels are the RGBA color components red, green, 
blue, and alpha. A color mask consists of four boolean values, one for each channel. A false
value prevents any change from being made to the corresponding color component in the color
buffer.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">color model.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">A way of specifying colors numerically.  Each color that can represented
in a color model is assigned one or more numerical component values.  An example is the RGB color
model, where a color is specified by three numbers giving the red, green, and blue components
of the color.</span>
</p>
<p class="glossary_item">
<span class="glossary_term">column-major order.</span>&nbsp;

            <span class="glossary_definition">A multi-pass rendering technique where a first pass processes the geometry and
saves relevant information such as transformed coordinates, normal vectors, and material properties.  The
data can be stored in textures, which are called "geometry buffers" or "G-buffers" in this context.
Lighting and other effects can then be computed in additional passes, using the pre-computed
information from the geometry buffers instead of re-computing it for each pass.</span>

pixel in the image.  When a new object is drawn at a pixel, the depth of the new object
is compared to the depth of the current object to decide which one is closer to the viewer.
The advantage of the depth test is that objects can be rendered in any order.  A disadvantage
is that only a limited range of depths can be represented in the image.</span>

is visible at a given point on the object,
a ray from the viewpoint is reflected from the surface point, and the reflected ray
is intersected with the texture cube.  Environment mapping is also called reflection mapping.</span>

<span class="glossary_term">extrusion.</span>&nbsp;
            <span class="glossary_definition">A technique for producing a solid from a 2D shape by
moving the shape along a curve in 3D.  The solid is the set of points through which
the shape passes as it moves along the curve.  The most common case is moving the shape

in computer graphics, the object that is produced by extrusion is just the surface of
the extruded solid.</span>
